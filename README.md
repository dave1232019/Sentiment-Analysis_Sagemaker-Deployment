# Sentiment-Analysis_Sagemaker-Deployment
To do Sentiment Analysis using RNN and Deploy a model using Amazon's Sagemaker platform

## Project Overview

Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project I will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I'll create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
